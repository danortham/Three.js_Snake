For this project I used the three.js editor. I created a point light and directional light.
 
I created a snake using cylinders of the spine and a box for the head. 
I also created a script to move the snake around in a square. I initally wanted to move the individual spines but that took too much time. 
I couldn't get this to work with tesla so to run it you will have to download it and run this script in the directory
This project made me feel grateful for the modern technology we have today such as blender or maya.

python3 -m http.server
then, in your browser paste 
 'http://localhost:8000/index.html'
